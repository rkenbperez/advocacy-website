        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
            Culture for Change is an advocacy organization focused on exploring the intersection of pop culture and social science. We believe that media, music, film, and entertainment play a crucial role in shaping societal attitudes, behaviors, and structures. By advocating for more inclusive, responsible, and accurate portrayals of identity, race, gender, and mental health, we aim to create positive change within both the entertainment industry and society as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal is to raise awareness about the societal implications of pop culture, encourage critical thinking, and push for media that empowers, educates, and challenges norms. We support creators and audiences in engaging with media that makes a real-world difference.

        <h2>Highlighted Issues</h2>
        <div class="issue-card">
            <h3>Representation in Media</h3>
            <p>Representation in media has a profound effect on how we view and treat others. Lack of diversity in film, TV, and advertising has led to stereotypes, misconceptions, and inequality. We advocate for equal representation of all communities, particularly underrepresented groups, to foster understanding and empathy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="issue-card">
            <h3>Toxic Masculinity in Pop Culture</h3>
            <p>Toxic masculinity is often glorified in mainstream media, reinforcing harmful stereotypes about gender and emotional expression. We explore how certain portrayals of manhood contribute to gender inequality, mental health issues, and societal violence. We aim to deconstruct these norms and promote healthier, more diverse portrayals of masculinity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="issue-card">
            <h3>Mental Health in the Media</h3>
            <p>Portrayals of mental health in media have historically been stigmatized or misunderstood. By advocating for more compassionate and accurate depictions, we seek to reduce stigma and encourage open conversations about mental well-being. Proper representation can help individuals feel seen, understood, and empowered to seek help.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="issue-card">
            <h3>Social Media and Its Impact</h3>
            <p>Social media platforms are now central to how we communicate, express ourselves, and consume information. However, they also play a role in spreading misinformation, exacerbating mental health issues, and creating echo chambers. We encourage critical engagement with social media, promoting digital literacy and accountability.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="issue-card">
            <h3>Cultural Appropriation vs. Appreciation</h3>
            <p>When cultural elements are used without respect or understanding, it can lead to cultural appropriation. We advocate for cultural appreciation over appropriation and seek to educate the public about the difference, promoting deeper understanding and respect for cultural practices around the world.</p>
